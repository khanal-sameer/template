      {
        "header": "Will the Redox Clay Mask exfoliate dead skin cells and eliminate blemishes?",

        "body": "No 100% bentonite clay mask on the market contains redox signaling molecules, which supports communication at the surface skin cellular level. In addition, our Redox Clay Mask is not 100% bentonite clay. It is a proprietary mix of bentonite, sodium magnesium fluorosilicate, and other ingredients. It is also pH-adjusted to maximize the redox cell signaling molecules while maintaining the stability of these molecules. Traditional clay masks focus on cleansing the skin only. The ASEA Redox Clay Mask both cleanses and rejuvenates simultaneously because of the redox molecules in our mask, and there is a synergistic effect on skin surface cells when these steps happen in tandem. The Redox Clay Mask also prepares skin to more effectively receive RENU28."
